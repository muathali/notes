# Writing with Flair

Principles of Exceptional Writing

1. Simplicity (concise writing)
2. Clarity (sharpness, brightness and focus, precise thinking on what you want to say)
3. Elegance (order and flow, structure and rhythm)
4. Evocativeness (evoking or tending to evoke an especially emotional response)
