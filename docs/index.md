# Writing with Flair

Principles of Exceptional Writing

1. Simplicity (concise writing)
2. Clarity (sharpness, brightness and focus, precise thinking on what you want to say)
3. Elegance (order and flow, structure and rhythm)
4. Evocativeness (evoking or tending to evoke an especially emotional response)

## whom

When in doubt, try this simple trick: If you can replace the word with “he”' or “'she,” use who. If you can replace it with “him” or “her,” use whom. Who should be used to refer to the subject of a sentence. Whom should be used to refer to the object of a verb or preposition.
