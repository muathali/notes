### Extended shortcuts

Enable Loop Playback (⌘L) and press ? to Play Around Edit
> This is a great way to repeatedly see part of a clip as the Playhead jumps a few seconds back, plays through the selected point, and plays a few seconds forward before starting again. It's useful in an edit on the Timeline too

Press ⌥X to remove a selection from all the selected clips

It is possible to create multiple In and Out points on a single clip, but the next section of the chapter makes this largely unnecessary. Still, if you need to select an additional range on a single clip, hold ⌘ while you drag on its thumbnail

Press F to mark the selection as a Favorite.

Press U to remove Favorites from the selection.

Press M to add a Marker
Press M twice to add a Marker and then edit it.
